# Alien Bounce

**A fast-paced arcade platformer built in a single weekend for a micro game jam.**  
Jump on aliens, flip in the air, stack points, and push your score to the limit — but don’t land on your head!

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

In this game, each alien you jump on multiplies your score by 2 while flipping your character 180°.  
If you manage to land safely **on your feet**, you collect all accumulated points.  
But if you fall **head-first**, you lose a life and earn **nothing** from that jump!

Simple to learn, hard to master, perfect for quick, intense runs.
